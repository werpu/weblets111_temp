For example, JavaServer Faces Renderers often need JavaScript, CSS and image resources.</p><p>Although dropping in an implementation JAR does make these components libraries available, the resource files must be extracted into the web application root. This can easily lead to inconsistency problems between implementation code and resource files.</p><p>Weblets aims to solve this problem, without placing undue burden on the application developer. Although JavaServer Faces is mentioned as an explicit example, Weblets aims to solve the general problem in a non-Faces-specific way, and then provide an integration with Faces.</p><p>The Weblets project was born during our book research for an easy way of loading resources directly out of JAR. The book is now available -        <a href="http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=10044">Pro JSF and Ajax: Building Rich Internet Components</a>, and the Weblets project is an important part of this work. The Weblets source has been available since Dec 4th. We will also be uploading collateral and samples as soon as possible.</p><p>John Fallows and Jonas Jacobi</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>News Update<br /></h3> 	<p>After being quiet for a while here a short news update regarding Weblets.</p><p> &nbsp; A wiki has been opened you can reach it <a title="Weblets Wiki" href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Projects/Weblets">here</a>, currently not too much information is in there, due to the fact<br />that most of the information I have are written directly in the docs, but every Wiki lives from the contributions of the end user,<br />so your information is vital.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Also Weblets has not been on a hiatus, development has been going on the last months. There will be a 1.1 version soon (I am close to a first beta). For more information about the planned features, visit the <a title="Weblets Wiki" href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Projects/Weblets">Wiki</a>  or ask in the users mailing list.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>               <h3>1.0 Released<br /></h3> 	<div class="app">Finally, we are proud to announce that Weblets 1.0 final has been released.</div><div class="app"> </div><div class="app">What is new compared to 0.4?</div><div class="app"> </div> 	<ul> 	<li>Weblets now has a full frontend api for neutral resource handling</li> 	<li>Frontend apis, for jsp, el, jsf and text resources</li> 	<li>It should work in any webframework via neutral JSP and Servlet fallbacks</li> 	<li>Lots of bugfixes and optimizations</li> 	<li>A url weblet for proxying url based resources</li> 	<li>Improved backend API to ease the  developers lives</li> 	<li>Lots and <a href="doc/longdoc/index.html">lots of new documentation</a>  </li> 	<li>Improved <a target="_blank" href="http://conference.irian.at/weblets-demo">examples</a>  to showcase weblets in various configurations</li> 	<li>And lots of bugfixes and internal changes</li> 	</ul> 	<div class="app"> </div><div class="app">You can <a href="http://weblets.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">download</a>  a binary and source bundle from the  <a href="http://weblets.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">Documents and Files</a>  section of</div><div class="app">this page. </div> 	<p><a href="https://weblets.dev.java.net/doc/longdoc/gettingstarted.html"><br /> 	</a></p> 	 	   	<p>A demo website has been opened, it showcases the weblets-demo application, and some sources, you can reach it by clicking <a target="_new" href="http://conference.irian.at/weblets-demo">this link.</a></p>              <h3>Documentation  1.0 Version</h3>        <p><a href="doc/longdoc/index.html">Site documentation: Weblets Users Guide (Long Documentation)</a></p>       <p><a href="doc/shortdoc/introduction.html">Site Documentation: Loading Resources With Weblets (Short Introduction)</a></p>                    <h3>Documentation Version 0.4</h3>       <p><a href="http://java.sys-con.com/read/159161.htm">JDJ article: Loading Resources With Weblets</a></p>       <p><a href="doc_04/introduction.html">Site documentation: Loading Resources With Weblets</a></p>       <div class="section"><h3>Mission</h3>       <p>Weblets will make resource file management and versioning as easy for Web        development as it already is today for desktop-based Java development.</p></div>     </div>
