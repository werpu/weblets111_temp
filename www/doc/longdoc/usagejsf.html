      <div class="section"><h2>Usage of Weblets in a jsf centric environment</h2>
<p>As <tt>Weblets</tt>
 originated from a project which was developed for an ajax and <tt>JSF</tt>
 centric book, <tt>Weblets</tt>
 has extensive tooling support for jsf, and tries to utilize JSFs internal structures extensively, to ease the configuration and usage for the application programmer.</p>
<p><tt>Weblets</tt>
 itself is not <tt>JSF</tt>
 centric, but besides its generic web framework coverage it has a very strong <tt>JSF</tt>
 tooling support. Over time it might be possible that other web frameworks could be supported in a similar way where needed.</p>
<p>The generic tooling support of course also works in JSF, but it doesnï¿½t have to be used, due to the easier configuration and usage of the internal <tt>JSF</tt>
 mechanisms</p>
<div class="section"><h3>Setup</h3>
<p>Details of the setup are described in the <a href="./setup.html">Setup guide</a>
.</p>
<div class="section"><h4>Setup Short summary:</h4>
<p>Every basic <tt>JSF</tt>
 setup should work out of the box in a plug and play way. The only thing you which is needed is a valid path triggering pattern for the faces servlet.</p>
<p><i>Code 0: valid path pattern in the web.xml </i>
</p>
<div class="source"><pre>   &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;Faces Servlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/faces/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
  &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>Of course file patterns can be used additionally.</p>
<p>Another limitation of this system is, if you use a <tt>Faces Servlet</tt>
 which is not the standard <tt>JSF</tt>
 one you have to do a fallback to the generic configuration! However you still can use all of the other features <tt>Weblets</tt>
 provides for jsf.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3>Basic Functions</h3>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Weblets APIs follow the general patterns as described in <a href="./generalapi.html">Weblets Users Guide: Introduction to the API Patterns</a>
. for further information please follow the link.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3>JSF Frontend APIs</h3>
<p>Over the years <tt>JSF</tt>
 has become the base technology of various frameworks and view technologies, hence to cover <tt>Weblets</tt>
 in <tt>JSF</tt>
 entirely, we have to cover several frontend technologies</p>
<div class="section"><h4>JSF 1.1</h4>
<p>Although nowadays basically a legacy technology, but still widely used, <tt>JSF</tt>
 1.1 has several limitations regarding its frontend technologies and the usage of EL. <tt>JSF</tt>
 1.1 in most cases relies on JSP as frontend view technology with its own api providing the additional work, and as <tt>EL</tt>
 it provides its own <tt>EL</tt>
 technology.</p>
<p>Now to use <tt>Weblets</tt>
 in <tt>JSF</tt>
 1.1, you have basically two options</p>
<ol type="1"><li>For cases outside of the <tt>JSF</tt>
 area (areas in your page outside of f:view) rely on basic jsp mechanisms as described in <a href="./usagejsp.html">JSP : Usage page</a>
</li>
<li>Within <tt>JSF</tt>
 areas you can rely on an <tt>EL</tt>
 dummy map provided automatically to your <tt>JSF</tt>
 system. To use it no additional configuration is needed</li>
</ol>
<p>The following code example showcases the usage of this <tt>EL</tt>
 dummy map:</p>
<p><i>Code 3: Usage or resource and url in a JSF frontend environment</i>
</p>
<div class="source"><pre>  &lt;h:outputText value=&quot;#{weblet.url['weblets.demo']['/welcome.js']}&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;h:graphicImage value=&quot;#{weblet.resource['weblets.demo']['/img/icon_alert.gif']}&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>In this example you can precisely see why you need sometimes resource <tt>weblet.resource</tt>
 or url <tt>weblet.url</tt>
, in this example h:graphicImage adds the application context itself so we dont need a full url including the web application context, instead we just need a path relative to it.</p>
<p><i>Code 4: Difference between url and resource in a JSF specific api</i>
</p>
<div class="source"><pre>   #{weblet.url['weblets.demo']['/welcome.js']}
</pre>
</div>
<p>Is a typical <tt>JSF</tt>
 dummy map. One of <tt>JSF</tt>
 1.1s <tt>EL</tt>
 implementation is, it does not allow functions which would easy the extension of the wel, all it allows is properties and maps. To allow a function like behavior you can map the functionality into dummy maps and pass the parameters over the map keys.</p>
</div>
<div class="section"><h4>Facelets and <tt>JSF</tt>
 1.2</h4>
<p>The last years facelets has become the frontend technology for many projects. One of the advantages of facelets is that it already provides a JSP 2.x and <tt>JSF</tt>
 1.2 el, so that you automatically can start to use the features of the <tt>EL</tt>
 in there. The above mentioned things also are valid for <tt>JSF</tt>
 1.2 which also has the latest <tt>EL</tt>
 implementation available.</p>
<p>If you are in a facelet domain you have two options to utilize weblets</p>
<ol type="1"><li>via <tt>EL</tt>
 functions (the same as in jsp 2.x)</li>
<li>via the above described dummy maps</li>
</ol>
<p>Newer <tt>EL</tt>
 implementations provide so called <tt>EL</tt>
 functions, those are functions which can be added to the actual <tt>EL</tt>
 implementation to extend its functionality. If you are in a system which uses newer <tt>EL</tt>
 implementations, it is highly recommended to use those instead of the dummy maps.</p>
<p>The next example shows how to use the <tt>EL</tt>
 functions:</p>
<p><i>Code 5: Usage of EL functions</i>
</p>
<div class="source"><pre>     xmlns:wbl=&quot;http://weblets.dev.java.net/tags_jsp2&quot; this has to be added to your namespace definitions

      &lt;h:outputText value=&quot;${weblet:url('weblets.demo','/welcome.js')}&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;h:graphicImage value=&quot;${weblet:resource('weblets.demo','/img/icon_alert.gif')}&quot; /&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>As you can see the calls are very similar, but instead of reverting into a (still available) <tt>JSF</tt>
 dummy map we call directly <tt>EL</tt>
 functions we added to our page by adding another xml namespace to our xmlns definitions.</p>
<p><b>For an extensive examples of the EL function calls, check out the weblets-demo application provided with your weblets download package</b>
</p>
<p>
    As for facelets, while providing an el function implementation, you currently can only
    use the jsf dummy maps in faclets. This limitation will be removed for weblets 1.1.
</p>


</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h3>Backend APIs for the Component and Bean Developers</h3>
<p>Component and backend authors in <tt>JSF</tt>
 generally face the problem, of not having a standardized way to load resources. The classical way is either to use</p>
<ul><li>a document root and relative resources</li>
<li>a view handler <tt>handler.getResourceURL(context, &quot;/myresources/myScript.js&quot;);</tt>
<p>In both methods you have to pack the resources into your application, you have to take care about their precise location in your document tree etc... This is burden and error prone, and resources can be traced down to their actual location which opens another door for hackers to bring in trojan horses! Besides that, changing the location or even physical source of any resource might cause changes in the entire application tree and even some components!</p>
<p>Now <tt>Weblets</tt>
 is here to solve all those problems. And again we revert to our proven url and uri notation.</p>
<p><tt>Weblets</tt>
 provides for many backend technologies Utils classes which provide the usual url and uri notations, <tt>JSF</tt>
 as well:</p>
<p><i>Code 6: Usage contractual API the &lt;&lt;&lt;JSF</i>
&gt;&gt; way&gt;</p>
<div class="source"><pre>    FacesWebletUtils.getURL(context, &quot;demo.webletname&quot;, &quot;/subpath/myresource.js&quot;)
    FacesWebletUtils.getResource(context, &quot;demo.webletname&quot;, &quot;/subpath/myresource.js&quot;)

    Context being the Faces Context!
</pre>
</div>
<p>That is basically it, nothing more and nothing less. It is easy to call <tt>Weblets</tt>
 from your backing bean or component, all you have to do is, to use the provided API calls! And then work with their return values as you would with other url strings!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section"><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The usage of <tt>Weblets</tt>
 in <tt>JSF</tt>
 is very easy, depending on your configuration you can either revert to</p>
<ul><li>Basic JSP mechanisms</li>
<li><tt>JSF</tt>
 dummy maps</li>
<li><tt>EL</tt>
 functions for newer <tt>EL</tt>
 implementations</li>
</ul>
<p>Also for the component and bean developers easy to use <tt>JSF</tt>
 specific APIs have been provided</p>
