Resources Weblets Usage Guide

    Not only java or jsp files have the problem of having to load resources.
    Resource loading is universal and not only limited to the domain of java or its
    derived technologies.\
    Resources can be loaded also by resource files. <<<Weblets>>> as universal solution to resource loading
    provides the hooks for CSS and javascript for authors who have to deal with the problem
    of having to load or reference resources in a neutral way.

*Basic Functions

** Introduction


    The Weblets APIs follow the general patterns as described in {{{./generalapi.html}Weblets Users Guide:  Introduction to the API Patterns}}.
    for further information please follow the link.


** <<<Weblets>>> and Javascript

    To support resource cross referencing in a neutral manner, <<<Weblets>>> adds another parsing step to
    generic text resources which pre-parses the resource for the occurrence of the contractual functions
    and then replaces them on the fly with the weblet url calls.\
    The browser, after the parsing step, can resolve the urls
    and can trigger the second weblet stage which serves the resources!

   Now to apply this we have to have in mind that every javascript file loaded
   by <<<Weblets>>> is parsed and searched for our weblet notation.
   Hence we can use api functions directly without influencing the actual code.

   <Code 0: Javascript Usage of the weblet api >

+----------------------------------------------------
   alert('weblet:url( "weblets.demo" , "/welcome.js" )');
   expands to alert('/myapp/weblets/demo/welcome.js')

   alert("weblet:resource( 'weblets.demo' , '/welcome.js' )");
   expands to alert("/weblets/demo/welcome.js")
+----------------------------------------------------

   <<Note: To ease the integration into various text based resource languages,
   the hyphenation normally found for strings was deliberately left out of the function definition!>>

** <<<Weblets>>> and CSS

   Everything said regarding javascript also applies to CSS, following code example will showcase
   the features <<<Weblets>>> adds to CSS

   <Code 1: CSS Usage of the weblet api >

+-----------------------------------------------------
     background-image: url( weblet:resource( "weblets.demo" , "/myimage.png" ) );

     will be expanded to
     background-image: url( /myapp/weblets/demo/myimage.png );
+-----------------------------------------------------

** Additional information

    Basically every text resource is parsed in the parsing stage.
    You can use the <<<Weblets>>> notation in everything text based!
    The referencing of relative resources in <<<Weblets>>> as well is no problem, you still
    can reference resources relatively without any limitations, however you have to have
    in mind, that those resources are referenced relatively to the expanded weblet url.
    Generally spoken it is saver to simply use the weblet notation for intra weblet resource
    references!


Summary

    <<<Weblets>>> resources can cross reference each other, a weblet function parser
    supports the direct referencing of resources via the weblet notation, out of
    every weblet loaded resource file.
